# Proposal:
All of the information that you included in the Pre-Proposal document (be sure to update your proposal to address any issues raised by the instructor)


What is the goal of your application? What problem will it try to solve?
The goal of this web application would be to preserve the history of Samuel Morris Hall and allow individuals to connect with friends from the past and discover new connections.

We do not really consider this project to be solving a problem, but it is a fun project that will help connect people in a unique way.

Why is this application relevant/meaningful? Who may use it and why? What are some difficulties associated with your project?

It seems like the first question people ask you once you have discovered you both have been to Taylor is what dorm you lived in. Since there is so much camaraderie between people in this way, it seems like it would be cool to create a place where people can look back on the history and to current state of where they once lived. Alumni, current students, as well as prospective students could benefit from such an application. Alumni might be interested in see who the new kids on the block are. Current students could use it as a platform to keep in contact with other floor members or check up on the history of their own rooms. The prospective students could use it to connect with current students and see if they would like to live there.

There may be difficulties with data integrity when associating students and rooms together for different time periods. 

Additionally, it may be difficult to derive eight meaningful tables within the scope of this project. 


Does a similar application already exist? If so, how is your application going to be different from it?
	A similar application does not exist explicitly for Taylor. One exists for Harvard, but we plan on improving on it. Ours will be different in that it will be more intuitively designed and interactive. The existing application is mainly a list that is searched through.
