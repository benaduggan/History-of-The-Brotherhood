      It started out with a simple discovery. My DA had lived in my room for three years before I had even stepped
      foot inside of it! He showed me a hidden token that he had left in the room from his time. This inspired me
      to start developing a rudimentary model of what this application could look like, and how it might be used by
      alumni and current students to connect over a shared experience. I started talking to an alumnus of the Brotherhood
      who currently works in Zondervan Library. He mentioned having a similar idea and we have continued to discuss the
      scope of this project and how it could be used to preserve the history of the Brotherhood and allow individuals to
      connect, remember the events from the past, and discover new information about the floor and its members that they
      had not known before.

      In the future I would like this to be a dashboard with some statistics about the website. We could show how many brothers
      have joined the site, how much of the history we have compiled for our overall history, or a carosel of random pictures
      that people have added to the site. There are sort of endless opportunities with this site...
